# christianjhidalgo.github.io

Working on my Github pages site. 
I was able to nab my own name domain- christianjhidalgo (christianhidalgo was already taken by goDaddy)

Added my domain www.christianjhidalgo.com to github pages via these instructions https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site

//Have to work on getting Jekyll on now.
//Got rid of Jekyll files in place of pure Html,Css,and JS for practice.
