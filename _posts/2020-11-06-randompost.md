Just testing my new blog post. This is a bit different than WordPress in that its kinda like a minimalist format. I am literally typing on a Notepad type of thing. 
But I enjoy the simpilicity of it all. Its been said that journaling, or blogging in our 2020 generation, helps the brain. I read an article on Medium that
stated one should do it right before bed time, as a way to express thoughts and prepare the brain for healing while we sleep. I have seen this practice done
in alot of movies and shows. Like that show with the girl from Scream Queens, I forgot her name and forgot the show, where she writes on a journal before bed. 
Also saw it in the Social Network, Mark Zuckerberg blogged in the beginning of the movie right before bed time. Maybe the studies hold truth.
